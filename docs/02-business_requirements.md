# ðŸ“˜ Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Project Name: Product Inventory Management System

## 1. Overview
A comprehensive, cloud-based inventory management system designed to handle multi-location inventory, warehouse operations, purchasing, sales, and advanced analytics. All services will be containerized using Docker for local deployment and consistency. The system will leverage Python 3.11 for backend services, PostgreSQL for data storage, and React for the frontend interface.

## 2. Goals
- Provide real-time inventory visibility across all locations
- Streamline warehouse operations with efficient workflows
- Enable data-driven decision making through advanced analytics
- Ensure high availability and security of inventory data
- Support integration with existing business systems
- Use Docker containers to ensure repeatable local development and isolation of services
